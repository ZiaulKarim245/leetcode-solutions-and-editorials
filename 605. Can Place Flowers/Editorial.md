If the flowerbed has only one plot and it's empty, then:

You can plant a flower if n <= 1.

Since the question asks for True or False, and planting one flower is always possible in a single empty plot, it immediately returns True if this situation is detected.

In a flowerbed, the first and last plots are special cases because they have only one adjacent plot.

If the first two plots are empty (flowerbed[0] and flowerbed[1]), plant a flower at position 0.

If the last two plots are empty (flowerbed[-2] and flowerbed[-1]), plant a flower at the last position.

Each time you plant a flower, increase the count by 1.

For all plots from index 1 to len(flowerbed)-2:

If the current plot and both its neighbors are empty, plant a flower there and increment the count.

At the end, check if the number of flowers you managed to plant (count) is greater than or equal to the number you needed to plant (n).

Return True if yes, else False.
