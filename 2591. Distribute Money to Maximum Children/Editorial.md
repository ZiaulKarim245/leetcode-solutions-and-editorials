Initially, we need to check if the number of children is greater than the available money. If it is, it’s impossible to give at least 1 dollar to every child, so we return -1.

After that, we give 1 dollar to each child and subtract this amount from the total money, since this is the minimum each child should receive.

Next, we try to find the maximum number of children who can receive 7 more dollars (making it 8 dollars total per child) because of the problem's constraints (which you might want to clarify in your problem statement).

Then, we handle special conditions:

1.If there’s only one child left and exactly 3 dollars remaining, we cannot give this child 7 dollars (since giving 3 would make their total 4, which seems to be a restricted case in the problem)so we need to adjust by subtracting one from the count.

2.If we’ve distributed 7 dollars to the maximum possible children but there’s still some money left, this means we over-allocated, so we need to adjust by subtracting one from the count.

3.If the number of children is less than the number of children who could get 7 dollars (i.e., we overestimated), we need to fix this by reducing one child from the count.

If none of these special cases occur, we return the maximum number of children who could receive 7 dollars.
