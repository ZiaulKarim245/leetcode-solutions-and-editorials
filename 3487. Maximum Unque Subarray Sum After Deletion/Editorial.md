Weâ€™ll solve this problem using the following steps:

Sort the array in ascending order

Sorting helps to group duplicate numbers together and makes it easier to compare neighboring elements.

Start by adding the largest number to the sum

Iterate from the second-largest number to the smallest

If the current number is positive and different from the next number (meaning it's unique at this position), add it to the sum
